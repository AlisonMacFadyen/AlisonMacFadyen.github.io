I am interested in microbial interactions, with a particular focus on inter-species interactions and co-evolution.  My research plans focus on developing wet laboratory and computational methods to support co-evolution studies.  Ultimately, I aim to use co-evolution to explore new avenues for antibiotic biosynthesis and development antimicrobial resistance.

I am always interested in developing new collaborations and applications for my work, [contact me](mailto:alison.macfadyen@tsl.ac.uk) if you would like to discuss potential projects.
