I am interested in microbial interactions, with a particular focus on inter-species interactions and co-evolution.  My research plans focus on developing wet laboratory and computational methods to support co-evolution studies.  Ultimately, I aim to use co-evolution to explore new avenues for antibiotic biosynthesis and development antimicrobial resistance.

I am always interested in developing new collaborations and applications for my work, [contact me](mailto:alison.macfadyen@tsl.ac.uk) if you would like to discuss potential projects.

## SCC*mec* Diversity in non-*aureus* staphylococci

Staphylococcal cassette chromosome *mec* (SCCmec), are mobile genetic elements responsible for conferring methicillin resistance in staphylococci and are highly diverse, with 15 types described. Non-*aureus* staphylococci can act as a reservoir for SCC*mec*, and often carry composite SCC*mec* elements. The exact prevalence, phylogenetic diversity and geographical spread of SCC*mec* in non-*aureus* staphylococci is unknown.

Recently the group was awarded a [Harry Smith Vacation Studentship](https://microbiologysociety.org/grants/all-grants-prizes/harry-smith-vacation-studentships.html) from the Microbiology Society.  This will support our research analysing the diversity of SCC*mec* in non-*aureus* staphylococci.
