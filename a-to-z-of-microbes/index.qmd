title: "A to Z of Microbes"
---

Welcome to the A to Z of Microbes.  Every two weeks I will write about a microorganism, either fungi, archae or bacteria, starting from A and finishing with Z.  Each post will be accompanied by a Q&A with an early career researcher working on the organism.

I hope you enjoy.
