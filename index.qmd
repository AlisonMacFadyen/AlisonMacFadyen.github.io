# Alison MacFadyen

I'm a computational biologist and molecular microbiologist based in Suffolk.  I study how antimicrobial resistance moves between bacterial species — specifically, how mobile genetic elements called SCC*mec* assemble and transfer within commensal staphylococcal populations, creating reservoirs that seed resistance into clinically important pathogens.


I develop bioinformatics tools to tackle these questions at scale.  My tool, [SCC*mec*Extractor](https://github.com/AlisonMacFadyen/SCCmecExtractor) enables the systematic detection and characterisation of SCC*mec* elements across the *Staphylococcus* genus.

I'm currently a Computational Biologist at [The Sainsbury Laboratory](https://www.tsl.ac.uk/) on the Norwich Research Park.  My background spans industrial biotechnology, environmental engineering and molecular epidemiology, with positions at the Universities of Strathclyde, Newcastle, Edinburgh and Glasgow.  I hold a PhD from the University of Strathclyde, in Molecular Microbiology and Genomics.

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:alison.macfadyen@tsl.ac.uk) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
