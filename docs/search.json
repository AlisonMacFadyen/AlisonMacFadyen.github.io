My research plans focus on developing wet laboratory and computational methods to support co-evolution studies. Ultimately, I aim to use co-evolution to explore new avenues for antibiotic biosynthesis and development antimicrobial resistance.\nI am always interested in developing new collaborations and applications for my work, contact me if you would like to discuss potential projects."

My past research positions have covered many research areas, from Industrial Biotechnology to Environmental Engineering and most recently Molecular Epidemiology. These roles have allowed me to apply my skills in molecular microbiology and computational biology.\nThis is my personal website to highlight my research, personal interests and my outreach project: The A to Z of Microbes.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."
