    "text": "SCCmec Diversity in Staphylococcus pseudintermedius\nHow does antimicrobial resistance spread between bacterial species? Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most pressing challenges in medical microbiology. While much attention has focused on resistance in individual pathogenic species, less is understood about how resistance determinants move between species, and in particular, what role commensal bacteria play as reservoirs and vehicles for resistance gene transfer.\nMy research addresses this question through the lens of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec): the mobile genetic element responsible for methicillin resistance in staphylococci and mammaliicocci. SCCmec is well characterised in Staphylococcus aureus, where it defines MRSA. But the broader Staphylococcus genus (including dozens of species that colonise skin, gut and mucosal surfaces of humans and animals), harbours a far greater diversity of SCCmec elements than has been appreciated. These non-aureus staphylococci may act as the evolutionary workshop where novel SCCmec elements are assembled before transferring into S. aureus and other pathogens."

I study how antimicrobial resistance moves between bacterial species — specifically, how mobile genetic elements called SCCmec assemble and transfer within commensal staphylococcal populations, creating reservoirs that seed resistance into clinically important pathogens.\nI develop bioinformatics tools to tackle these questions at scale. My tool, SCCmecExtractor enables the systematic detection and characterisation of SCCmec elements across the Staphylococcus genus.\nI’m currently a Computational Biologist at The Sainsbury Laboratory on the Norwich Research Park. My background spans industrial biotechnology, environmental engineering and molecular epidemiology, with positions at the Universities of Strathclyde, Newcastle, Edinburgh and Glasgow.

    "text": "SCCmec Diversity in non-aureus staphylococci\nStaphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), are mobile genetic elements responsible for conferring methicillin resistance in staphylococci and are highly diverse, with 15 types described. Non-aureus staphylococci can act as a reservoir for SCCmec, and often carry composite SCCmec elements. The exact prevalence, phylogenetic diversity and geographical spread of SCCmec in non-aureus staphylococci is unknown.\nRecently the group was awarded a Harry Smith Vacation Studentship from the Microbiology Society. This will support our research analysing the diversity of SCCmec in non-aureus staphylococci.\n\n\n\nSCCmec Diversity in Staphylococcus pseudintermedius"

    "text": "This week I’ve been learning more about the mobilome and resistome of Staphylococcus aureus, de novo acquisition of resistance and strategies to employ for using GitHub for research management.\n\n\nPaper: Contarin R, Drapeau A, François P, Madec J, Haenni M, Dordet-Frisoni E.2024.The interplay between mobilome and resistome in Staphylococcus aureus. mBio15:e02428-24. https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02428-24\nTake Home:\nThis study investigates the relationship between mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in Staphylococcus aureus by analysing over 10,000 genomes from both human and animal sources. Key findings include:\n\nDiversity of MGEs and ARGs: A remarkable variety of MGEs (e.g., plasmids and transposons) were identified as key carriers of ARGs.\nMGE/ARG Associations: Numerous associations were found, indicating MGEs are crucial for the horizontal transfer and dissemination of resistance genes.\nCross-Species Spread: High similarity in MGE/ARG associations between human and animal isolates highlights the potential for ARGs to spread freely between hosts.\nSpread Across Strains: MGEs and their associated ARGs can spread between different sequence types (STs), facilitating the evolution and adaptation of S. aureus clones in selective environments.\nVariability Within STs: The variability of MGE/ARG associations within individual STs underscores the dynamic role of MGEs in shaping resistance profiles.\n\nOverall, the study emphasizes the importance of understanding MGE-mediated ARG transfer to address the emergence of multidrug-resistant S. aureus clones in both human and animal health.\nKey Figure**:\nEnsure to cite properly and give a good legend\n\n\n\nOccurrence and families of Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome. Black bars represent human associated S. aureus, white represents animal. This image was extracted from Figure 3 in the paper.\n\n\nMy thoughts:\nInteresting to note that SCCmec Type XII is the most prominent SCCmec found in the animal isolates of SA.\nType XIII-XV are missing. They authors used SCCmecFinder and the following are missing from that database: Type XIII (MG674089), Type XIV (LC440647) and Type XV (CP080249). It is also not clear from SCCmecFinder what the extended database includes.\nInvestigating this I happened to come across sccmec which appears to be a SCCmec typing tool that includes the current Types (Type I-XV). If you are interested in SCCmec typing then I recommend having a look: https://GitHub.com/rpetit3/sccmec.\n\n\n\nPaper: Wang X, Koster AD, Koenders BB, Jonker M, Brul S,ter Kuile BH.0.De novo acquisition of antibiotic resistance in six species of bacteria. Microbiol Spectr0:e01785-24. https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.01785-24\nTake Home:\n\nIntroduction:\n\nTwo methods of acquiring resistance\n\nAcquisition of resistance genes through horizontal gene transfer\nde novo development of resistance\n\n6 bacterial species found in the food chain exposed to increasing sublethal doses of antibiotics\n\nSpecies examined: Salmonella enterica subspecies. houtenae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis and Acinetobacter pittii.\nAntibiotics tested: Amoxicillin or Cefepime (Gram-negative or Gram-positive respectively), Enrofloxacin, Kanamycin, Tetracycline, Erythromycin and Chloramphenicol.\nExperiment duration: between 20 and 50 days.\n\nWhole genome sequencing was carried out at two time points during the experiment\n\nMiddle and end point, which correspond to\nTo attain information on mutations that lead the phenotypic changes\n\n\nFindings:\n\nAll 6 isolates could develop high levels of resistance\nResistance for each bacterium-antibiotic combinations occurs with different mutations\nNumber of mutations varies, they found Yersinia enterocolitica had the most\nA mutational pattern of gyrA combined with parC was conserved in 5 out of 6 species with relation to fluoroquinolone resistance\nMutations in genes coding for effluent pumps are widely encountered in Gram-negative species\n\nConclusion:\n\nDiverse genetic changes can lead to similar phenotypic outcomes.\n\n\n\nKey Figures:\n\n\n\nThe mutational pattern examined in six species of bacteria against six antibiotics. From Figure 6 within the paper\n\n\nMy thoughts:\nI liked that the authors also examined the fitness cost of resistance acquisition and it was interesting to see that *Y. enterocolitica** had extreme fitness cost due to the large number of mutations it had acquired. The authors note that only 8-20% of the mutations observed at the first time point (middle of the experiment) were maintained at the end. This suggests that more beneficial mutations are acquired and retained over time.\n\n\n\nPaper: Chen KY, Toro-Moreno M, Subramaniam AR (2025) GitHub enables collaborative and reproducible laboratory research.
