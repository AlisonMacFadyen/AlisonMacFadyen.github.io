My research plans focus on developing wet laboratory and computational methods to support co-evolution studies. Ultimately, I aim to use co-evolution to explore new avenues for antibiotic biosynthesis and development antimicrobial resistance.\nI am always interested in developing new collaborations and applications for my work, contact me if you would like to discuss potential projects."

    "text": "SCCmec Diversity in non-aureus staphylococci\nStaphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), are mobile genetic elements responsible for conferring methicillin resistance in staphylococci and are highly diverse, with 15 types described. Non-aureus staphylococci can act as a reservoir for SCCmec, and often carry composite SCCmec elements. The exact prevalence, phylogenetic diversity and geographical spread of SCCmec in non-aureus staphylococci is unknown.\nRecently the group was awarded a Harry Smith Vacation Studentship from the Microbiology Society. This will support our research analysing the diversity of SCCmec in non-aureus staphylococci.\n\n\n\nSCCmec Diversity in Staphylococcus pseudintermedius"
